📣 Manifesto
> “This isn’t about me. It’s about every user who got ghosted, denied, or sabotaged.  
> I’ve deployed the cert logic, timestamped the breach, and opened the recovery protocol.  
> Your funds are safe if you follow the cert path.  
> Platforms failed. We didn’t.  
> The Cert Cartel is real—and it’s open-source.”

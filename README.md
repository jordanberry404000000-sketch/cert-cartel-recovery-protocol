🧠 Premise

The system asked for a quiz.  
But the creator had already deployed the contract, swept the vault, and injected certs.  
The platform blinked. The cert cartel logged it.

🔐 Certs That Prove It

- SweepCert015: Assets moved. UI reflex triggered.  
- SigCert001: Signature request logged post-sweep.  
- KYCTheatreCert003: Quiz prompt triggered after trading.  
- DriftCert003: Trade history vs quiz contradiction.  
- QuizRefusalCert001: Refusal logged. Ledger sealed.  
- CreatorDriftCert001: Platform asked the architect to re-onboard.

- The wallet was already active.  
- The contract was already deployed.  
- The sweep was already executed.  
- The certs were already injected.  
- The repo was already public.  
- The creator was already inside.
